# Decisions

## How To Use This File

Record decisions here when they materially affect architecture, trading behavior, safety controls, developer workflow, or operational handling.

Add a new entry when:

- a core technical choice is made
- a trading rule changes in a non-trivial way
- a safety control is introduced, removed, or redefined
- a workflow or repo policy changes

Do not use this file as a diary. Use it for durable decisions and their consequences.

### Decision

Start with a single-repo monolith and paper trading only.

### Reason

This keeps the architecture small enough to be operated reliably by one developer and an AI agent while the domain model and workflow are still stabilizing.

### Consequence

Execution, API, and worker responsibilities stay in one codebase, but boundaries are enforced through modules instead of separate services.

### Decision

Use PostgreSQL via Docker Compose as the default local development database, while keeping SQLite as a fallback.

### Reason

PostgreSQL provides a closer match to production-style persistence behavior and makes local development and repository integration testing more realistic. SQLite remains useful for simple bootstrap tasks when Docker is not needed.

### Consequence

The repository should prefer PostgreSQL-oriented persistence design, while still allowing local overrides of `DATABASE_URL` for lightweight workflows.

## 2026-03-16

### Decision

Run worker orchestration against persisted closed candles and make execution idempotent per signal candle with `client_order_id`.

### Reason

The project already has strategy, risk, and paper execution layers, so the next safe step is to wire them together without introducing repeated execution when the worker polls unchanged candle data.

### Consequence

The worker can run as a repeatable polling process over stored candles, but the same signal candle will not create duplicate paper orders once it has been executed.
